 Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 1, the first 10 terms will be: 
 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ....
 
A number n is entered from the keyboard, prints the nth fibonacci number and sums the fibonacii numbers from 1 to n.

Example: n = 5
output: 5


with 1 <= n <= 1000
