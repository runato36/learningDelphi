Problem Description
Here's a simple 4 function calculator program that was written to meet some specific requirements.   It's an interesting story:   
The calculator was written for the psychology department of a university for use in testing primary school children.  
Since is to be used on screen with a PowerPoint presentation (PowerPoint is Microsoft's slide show program), the requirement was 
that it be kind of wide and short.  That way it will fit across the bottom of the screen.  Also, since the kiddies may not key 
very well, they wanted the keystrokes to be displayed as well as the answers.
